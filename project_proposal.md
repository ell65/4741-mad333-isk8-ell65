Project Proposal- Due Sept. 30, 2019 <br>
Group Members: Max de Ledebur (mad333), Ian Konigsberg (isk8), Elizabeth Lentine (ell65) <br>
Wine quality dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/rajyellow46/wine-quality <br>
Background: <br>
We are a specialized team working on new, cutting-edge technologies in the wine industry. We are coders looking to develop a high performing program that can quickly identify the best wines the world has to offer without actually tasting the wine! We hope to dial in the science, rather than the art, of wine-making. As a result, we could create a “golden formula” of physicochemicals of which wine-makers should strive to achieve.  While we cannot necessarily provide any insight regarding the wine-making process, we hope to give wine-makers an analysis tool to judge their own work.  <br>
We can use our computer program to “double-check” our company’s wine-making process and to protect our brand name. For example, pretend we have ten new wines we want to release this year. We hope that our program will efficiently categorize these new wines (based on physicochemical properties) into quality categories of Low, Medium, and High. After our analysis, our company may want to reconsider releasing any wines that score in the low quality category while prioritizing the release of the high scoring wines. <br>
Objectives: <br>
The main goal of our project is to consistently rate wines based on their physicochemical analysis. We hope to find <br>
Which specific wine characteristics factor more into the quality of the wine <br>
The exact relationship between those characteristics and wine quality <br>
The differences between how red wine and white wine qualities are scored <br>
Why this dataset allows us to answer question: <br>
Can see the impact of different combinations of chemical properties on quality scoring <br>
Having wine type column allows us to fine tune the model to each wine type <br>
Can help us identify things such as the ideal alcohol percentage or acidity for making good quality wines <br>
