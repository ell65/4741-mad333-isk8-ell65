# ORIE 4741 Project Midterm Report
## Elizabeth Lentine, Ian Konigsberg, Maximilian de Ledebur

Our group has spent significant time looking into the context of the data we are using for this project. Our Kaggle data reports on the physicochemical properties of red and white varieties of the Portuguese Vinho Verde ("veeng-yo vaird"), which translates to "green wine". This refers not to the color of the wine or the grapes but the fact that the wines are released a few short months (3-6) after harvest. The Vinho Verde region is the largest and one of the oldest winemaking regions in Portugal and is loved by many for its distinct qualities. Some of these include:

- Generally low alcohol content
- Refreshing, fruity flavor
- Great pairing with salad and seafood
- Lower prices per bottle, on average
